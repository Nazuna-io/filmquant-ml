# Implementation Summary

## 1. Improved Error Handling and Input Validation

- Enhanced API input validation with comprehensive Pydantic models
- Added validators for field-specific validation (e.g., date formats, ID existence)
- Implemented robust error handling with proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Created a centralized logging system for consistent application logging
- Added detailed error messages and stack traces for debugging

Key files:
- `/app/api/routes.py` - Improved API route handlers with better validation
- `/app/utils/logging.py` - Centralized logging configuration
- `/app/main.py` - Enhanced application entry point with error handling middleware
- `/tests/test_error_handling.py` - Unit tests for error handling and validation

## 2. Data Ingestion Pipeline

- Created a flexible data ingestion pipeline for preprocessing training data
- Implemented a set of reusable data processors for common operations:
  - Data cleaning and standardization
  - Date feature extraction
  - Categorical encoding
  - Numerical feature transformation
  - Data splitting for training/validation
  - Feature selection
- Added configuration-based pipeline setup for easy adjustment
- Implemented comprehensive logging for tracking pipeline operations

Key files:
- `/app/data_ingestion/pipeline.py` - Core pipeline infrastructure
- `/app/data_ingestion/processors.py` - Individual data processing components
- `/app/data_ingestion/ingest.py` - CLI tool for running the pipeline
- `/config/data_ingestion_default.json` - Default pipeline configuration
- `/tests/test_data_ingestion.py` - Unit tests for the data ingestion pipeline

## 3. Model Evaluation Framework

- Built a comprehensive framework for model evaluation and tracking
- Implemented evaluation metrics for regression tasks (MAE, MAPE, RMSE)
- Added support for prediction interval evaluation with coverage metrics
- Created visualization tools for model performance analysis
- Implemented a model tracking system to compare different model versions
- Added reporting functionality for model evaluation results

Key files:
- `/app/evaluation/metrics.py` - Evaluation metrics calculation
- `/app/evaluation/model_tracker.py` - Model version tracking and comparison
- `/app/evaluation/visualization.py` - Visualization tools for model evaluation
- `/app/evaluation/evaluate.py` - CLI tool for running model evaluation
- `/tests/test_evaluation.py` - Unit tests for the evaluation framework

## Additional Improvements

- Updated project documentation (README.md)
- Added dependencies to requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
- Improved overall code structure and organization
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all new components

## Next Steps

Possible next improvements could include:
- Integrating the data ingestion pipeline with cloud storage (GCS)
- Enhancing the model tracker with cloud-based model versioning
- Implementing an automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment
- Adding a web interface for the evaluation framework
- Creating a dashboard for tracking model performance over time
